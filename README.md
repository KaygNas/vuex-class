# vuex-class

Binding helpers for Vuex and vue-class-component.

This repository is fork from [ktsn/vuex-class](https://github.com/ktsn/vuex-class).

## Dependencies

- [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)
- [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex)
- [vue-class-component](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component)

## Attention

- This forking is trying to help project using vue2 migrate to vue3.
- There only little changes of dependencies version in `package.json` and test suits from `vuex-class@0.3.2`, nothing more.
- Since the next version of `vue-class-component` stayed rc for over two years, it's recommended not to depend on `vuex-class` for further coding.
- This forking might not be maintain for anymore.
